    english: 'I think modern Chinese culture is very inclusive. It not only includes various cultural refinements that have been preserved from the ancient and modern dynasties and various generations of folk officials. With the improvement of living standards, confidence in traditional culture has also been integrated into modern China. With the cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, modern Chinese culture has also absorbed the cultural characteristics of various countries, making modern Chinese culture more all-encompassing.',
    chinese: '我认为现代中国文化是非常包容的，不仅包含了从古自今各朝各代民间官方交集所保留的各种文化提炼，随着人们生活水平提升，对于传统文化的自信也被融入了现代中国文化，随着中国与世界各地文化交流，现代中国文化也吸纳了各国的文化特点，让现代中国文化变得更加包罗万象。',
